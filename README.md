![Electric Vehicle Analysis Dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/f635fc42-1c32-4bd1-8108-235b2bd8bfdb/0f64cb630066ae6631d2?experience=power-bi)

## Project Overview
This Power BI project analyzes the electric vehicle (EV) population data in the United States, providing insights into the growth and distribution of EVs and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs).

## Data Source
The data is sourced from [Kaggle's Electric Vehicle Population Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ratikkakkar/electric-vehicle-population-data).

## Problem Statement
The project aims to address the following key performance indicators (KPIs):
1. Total Vehicles: Understand the overall landscape of electric vehicles, encompassing both BEVs and PHEVs, to assess the market's size and growth.
2. Average Electric Range: Determine the average electric range of the vehicles to gauge technological advancements and efficiency.
3. Total BEV Vehicles and % of Total BEV Vehicles: Identify and analyze the total number and percentage of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) in the dataset.
4. Total PHEV Vehicles and % of Total PHEV Vehicles: Identify and analyze the total number and percentage of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) in the dataset.

## Key Features
- Interactive dashboard with filters for City, Electric Utility, and Electric Vehicle Type
- Visualizations for total vehicle count, average electric range, and BEV vs PHEV distribution
- Time series analysis of EV adoption from 2010 to 2025
- Geographical distribution of EVs across US states
- Top 10 EV manufacturers and models
- Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility breakdown

## Technologies Used
- Power BI
- Microsoft Excel

## How to Use
1. Download the .pbix file from [Power BI portal](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/f635fc42-1c32-4bd1-8108-235b2bd8bfdb/0f64cb630066ae6631d2?experience=power-bi).
2. Open the file using Power BI Desktop

## Key Insights
1. Total Vehicles: 205.38K electric vehicles analyzed
2. Average Electric Range: 52.13 km
3. BEV Distribution: 79% of total vehicles (161K)
4. PHEV Distribution: 21% of total vehicles (44K)
5. Top Manufacturer: Tesla leads with 90K vehicles
6. Top Models: Model Y (43K vehicles), Model 3 (32K), Leaf (13K)
7. CAFV Eligibility: 55.59% (114K) vehicles are eligible for Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle status
8. Time Trend: Significant growth in EV adoption, peaking at 61K vehicles in 2022

## Skills Demonstrated:
1. Data Analysis
2. Data Visualization
3. Power BI
4. Dashboard Design
5. KPI Development and Tracking

## Future Work
- Incorporate time-series analysis for forecasting future EV adoption rates beyond 2025
- Add more granular geographical analysis at the county or city level
- Include cost analysis and comparison with traditional vehicles
- Analyze the factors contributing to the drop in EV adoption after 2022
